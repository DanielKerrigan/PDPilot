PDPilot is a Jupyter widget for exploring partial dependence plots (PDPs) and individual conditional expectation (ICE) plots. You can find the code on `GitHub <https://github.com/DanielKerrigan/PDPilot>`_.

.. .. admonition:: User Study

..    We are conducting a user study to evaluate how machine learning (ML) practitioners use PDPilot to analyze the behavior of a ML model. We are looking for ML practitioners who have experience using PDP or ICE plots to participate. The study will be conducted over video call and will take approximately 90 minutes. Participants will be instructed how to use the tool, will analyze a model, and will then complete a brief interview. Participants will be compensated with a $30 Amazon gift card. If you are interested in participating, please fill out this `form <https://forms.gle/JjFb3qcVWj7dk7cq8>`_.
   
..    This study is being conducted by Daniel Kerrigan and Enrico Bertini at the Khoury College of Computer Sciences at Northeastern University. For any questions, please reach out to Daniel at kerrigan.d@northeastern.edu.
